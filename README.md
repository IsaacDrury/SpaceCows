# SpaceCows
This game was made for Team Escape Rooms and is intended to be played at the end of one of their rooms.

It is built for 1920 x 1080 resolution. It was playtested with a Thrustmaster brand joystick, but any similar joystick should be compatible.

In the game, the player escapes from an alien planet and has to shoot alien cows that are attacking them as they escape through space to get back to Earth.
